# YouTube Download Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues on Cloud Platforms (Render, Heroku, etc.)

### 1. "Video unavailable" Error
**Cause**: YouTube blocks many cloud service IP addresses to prevent automated downloads.

**Solutions**:
- Try different public videos (music videos, trailers, etc.)
- Avoid private, age-restricted, or geo-blocked content
- Use videos from major channels that are publicly accessible

### 2. "Private video" Error  
**Cause**: The video requires authentication or special permissions.

**Solutions**:
- Use only public videos
- Avoid unlisted or private videos
- Try videos from verified channels

### 3. "Sign in required" Error
**Cause**: YouTube requires authentication for this content.

**Solutions**:
- Choose videos that don't require login
- Avoid age-restricted content
- Use mainstream, public content

## Best Practices for Cloud Deployment

### Recommended Video Types:
✅ **Official music videos**  
✅ **Movie trailers**  
✅ **Public educational content**  
✅ **Creative Commons videos**  
✅ **News broadcasts**  

### Avoid:
❌ Private or unlisted videos  
❌ Age-restricted content  
❌ Geo-blocked videos  
❌ Live streams  
❌ Videos requiring authentication  

## Technical Solutions

### 1. User-Agent Rotation
The app uses browser-like headers to appear more legitimate.

### 2. Retry Mechanism
- 3 automatic retry attempts
- Different extraction strategies
- Progressive backoff

### 3. Quality Limiting
- Limited to 720p for faster processing
- Reduces server load and timeout issues

## Local vs Cloud Differences

**Local Development**: 
- Your ISP's IP address
- Usually not blocked by YouTube
- Better success rate

**Cloud Deployment**:
- Shared cloud IP addresses
- Often blocked by YouTube
- More restrictive environment

## Alternative Solutions

If cloud deployment continues to have issues:

1. **VPN Integration**: Add VPN proxy support
2. **Multiple Endpoints**: Use different cloud providers
3. **Client-Side Solutions**: Browser extensions
4. **Desktop Applications**: Electron-based apps
